Who's in the Computer
=====================

A desktop application based on the game Who's in the Bag.

How to play
-----------

The game is set up by sorting 3 or more players into 2 or more teams. You then
create a hotseat where a player will sit when he or she has their turn.

The aim of the game is to describe the person, place or thing that is shown on
the application to the other members in your team without saying any of words
contained in the title of what you are describing. The members in the team
must then try and guess it. Once a member has said the correct full title the
player who is describing can then press the correct button on the application
and move onto describing the next card. Passes may be allowed which is set
during the game setup dialog. Once the time limit is up, the team is awarded
usually 1 point per correct card. If the player describing the card
accidently says a word contained in the title, he or she must click the foul
button which will deduct normally 2 points from the team.

A virtual bag of cards is kept. Every correct or fouled card is taken out of
the bag and will no longer appear again until the card database is reset. Any
cards that a team was unable to guess within the time limit is kept in the bag
and may come up again for any team. Other teams must stay silent during another
team's turn. It is wise to have the computer sound on so that cheating can be
spotted if a player was to click correct when no card was guess correctly.

Adding new cards
----------------

New cards and categories can be added by editing the csv file which is
distributed with the application.

Compiling
---------

The application can be compiled with .NET Framework 3.5 or later. A mono
version has not yet been tested.

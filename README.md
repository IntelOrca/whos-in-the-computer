Who's in the Computer
=====================

A desktop application based on the game Who's in the Bag.

How to play
-----------

The game is set up by sorting three or more players into two or more teams.
You then create a hot seat in front of the computer where a player will sit
when he or she has their turn.

The aim of the game is to describe the person, place or thing that is shown on
the screen to the other members in your team without saying any of words
contained in the title of what you are describing. The members in the team
must then try and guess it. Once a member has said the correct full title the
player who is describing can then press the "Correct" button and move onto
describing the next card, which is automatically displayed. Passes may be
allowed as defined during the game setup dialog. Once the time limit is up,
the team is awarded 1 point (configurable) per correct card. If the player
describing the card accidently says a word contained in the title, he or she
must click the "Foul" button which will deduct 2 points (configurable) from
the team's score. "Next" and "Previous" buttons can be pressed to revisit
cards that have been passed.

A virtual bag of cards is kept. Every correct or fouled card is taken out of
the bag and will no longer appear again until the card database is reset. Any
cards that a team was unable to guess within the time limit is kept in the bag
and may come up again for any team. Other teams must stay silent during another
team's turn. Having the computer sound on discourages cheating as the other teams
will hear when the "correct" and "foul" buttons are pressed.

Adding new cards
----------------

New cards and categories can be added by editing the csv file which is
distributed with the application.

Compiling
---------

The application can be compiled with .NET Framework 3.5 or later. It has not
been tested with Mono.
